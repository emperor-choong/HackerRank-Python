# Arithmetic Operators

**Task**  
The provided code stub reads two integers from STDIN, $a$ and $b$. Add code to print three lines where:
1. The first line contains the sum of the two numbers.
2. The second line contains the difference of the two numbers (first - second).
3. The third line contains the product of the two numbers.

**Example**  
$a = 3$  
$b = 5$

Print the following:
```python
8
-2
15
```

**Input Format**  
The first line contains the first integer, $a$.  
The second line contains the second integer, $b$.

**Constraints**  
$1 \le a \le 10^{10}$  
$1 \le b \le 10^{10}$  

**Output Format**  
Print the three lines as explained above.

**Sample Input 0**
```python
3
2
```

**Sample Output 0**
```python
5
1
6
```

**Explanation 0**  
$3 + 2 \Rightarrow 5$  
$3 - 2 \Rightarrow 1$  
$3 * 2 \Rightarrow 6$
